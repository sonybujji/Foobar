Challenge 1:

Distract the Guards
===================

The time for the mass escape has come, and you need to distract the guards so that the bunny prisoners can make it out! Unfortunately for you, they're watching the bunnies closely. Fortunately, this means they haven't realized yet that the space station is about to explode due to the destruction of the LAMBCHOP doomsday device. Also fortunately, all that time you spent working as first a minion and then a henchman means that you know the guards are fond of bananas. And gambling. And thumb wrestling.

The guards, being bored, readily accept your suggestion to play the Banana Games.

You will set up simultaneous thumb wrestling matches. In each match, two guards will pair off to thumb wrestle. The guard with fewer bananas will bet all their bananas, and the other guard will match the bet. The winner will receive all of the bet bananas. You don't pair off guards with the same number of bananas (you will see why, shortly). You know enough guard psychology to know that the one who has more bananas always gets over-confident and loses. Once a match begins, the pair of guards will continue to thumb wrestle and exchange bananas, until both of them have the same number of bananas. Once that happens, both of them will lose interest and go back to guarding the prisoners, and you don't want THAT to happen!

For example, if the two guards that were paired started with 3 and 5 bananas, after the first round of thumb wrestling they will have 6 and 2 (the one with 3 bananas wins and gets 3 bananas from the loser). After the second round, they will have 4 and 4 (the one with 6 bananas loses 2 bananas). At that point they stop and get back to guarding.

How is all this useful to distract the guards? Notice that if the guards had started with 1 and 4 bananas, then they keep thumb wrestling! 1, 4 -> 2, 3 -> 4, 1 -> 3, 2 -> 1, 4 and so on.

Now your plan is clear. You must pair up the guards in such a way that the maximum number of guards go into an infinite thumb wrestling loop!

Write a function solution(banana_list) which, given a list of positive integers depicting the amount of bananas the each guard starts with, returns the fewest possible number of guards that will be left to watch the prisoners. Element i of the list will be the number of bananas that guard i (counting from 0) starts with.

The number of guards will be at least 1 and not more than 100, and the number of bananas each guard starts with will be a positive integer no more than 1073741823 (i.e. 2^30 -1). Some of them stockpile a LOT of bananas.



Challenge 2:

Free the Bunny Prisoners
========================

You need to free the bunny prisoners before Commander Lambda's space station explodes! Unfortunately, the commander was very careful with her highest-value prisoners - they're all held in separate, maximum-security cells. The cells are opened by putting keys into each console, then pressing the open button on each console simultaneously. When the open button is pressed, each key opens its corresponding lock on the cell. So, the union of the keys in all of the consoles must be all of the keys. The scheme may require multiple copies of one key given to different minions.

The consoles are far enough apart that a separate minion is needed for each one. Fortunately, you have already freed some bunnies to aid you - and even better, you were able to steal the keys while you were working as Commander Lambda's assistant. The problem is, you don't know which keys to use at which consoles. The consoles are programmed to know which keys each minion had, to prevent someone from just stealing all of the keys and using them blindly. There are signs by the consoles saying how many minions had some keys for the set of consoles. You suspect that Commander Lambda has a systematic way to decide which keys to give to each minion such that they could use the consoles.

You need to figure out the scheme that Commander Lambda used to distribute the keys. You know how many minions had keys, and how many consoles are by each cell.  You know that Command Lambda wouldn't issue more keys than necessary (beyond what the key distribution scheme requires), and that you need as many bunnies with keys as there are consoles to open the cell.

Given the number of bunnies available and the number of locks required to open a cell, write a function solution(num_buns, num_required) which returns a specification of how to distribute the keys such that any num_required bunnies can open the locks, but no group of (num_required - 1) bunnies can.

Each lock is numbered starting from 0. The keys are numbered the same as the lock they open (so for a duplicate key, the number will repeat, since it opens the same lock). For a given bunny, the keys they get is represented as a sorted list of the numbers for the keys. To cover all of the bunnies, the final answer is represented by a sorted list of each individual bunny's list of keys.  Find the lexicographically least such key distribution - that is, the first bunny should have keys sequentially starting from 0.

num_buns will always be between 1 and 9, and num_required will always be between 0 and 9 (both inclusive).  For example, if you had 3 bunnies and required only 1 of them to open the cell, you would give each bunny the same key such that any of the 3 of them would be able to open it, like so:
[
  [0],
  [0],
  [0],
]
If you had 2 bunnies and required both of them to open the cell, they would receive different keys (otherwise they wouldn't both actually be required), and your answer would be as follows:
[
  [0],
  [1],
]
Finally, if you had 3 bunnies and required 2 of them to open the cell, then any 2 of the 3 bunnies should have all of the keys necessary to open the cell, but no single bunny would be able to do it.  Thus, the answer would be:
[
  [0, 1],
  [0, 2],
  [1, 2],
]

Level 5:

Expanding Nebula
================

You've escaped Commander Lambda's exploding space station along with numerous escape pods full of bunnies. But - oh no! - one of the escape pods has flown into a nearby nebula, causing you to lose track of it. You start monitoring the nebula, but unfortunately, just a moment too late to find where the pod went. However, you do find that the gas of the steadily expanding nebula follows a simple pattern, meaning that you should be able to determine the previous state of the gas and narrow down where you might find the pod.

From the scans of the nebula, you have found that it is very flat and distributed in distinct patches, so you can model it as a 2D grid. You find that the current existence of gas in a cell of the grid is determined exactly by its 4 nearby cells, specifically, (1) that cell, (2) the cell below it, (3) the cell to the right of it, and (4) the cell below and to the right of it. If, in the current state, exactly 1 of those 4 cells in the 2x2 block has gas, then it will also have gas in the next state. Otherwise, the cell will be empty in the next state.

For example, let's say the previous state of the grid (p) was:
.O..
..O.
...O
O...

To see how this grid will change to become the current grid (c) over the next time step, consider the 2x2 blocks of cells around each cell.  Of the 2x2 block of [p[0][0], p[0][1], p[1][0], p[1][1]], only p[0][1] has gas in it, which means this 2x2 block would become cell c[0][0] with gas in the next time step:
.O -> O
..

Likewise, in the next 2x2 block to the right consisting of [p[0][1], p[0][2], p[1][1], p[1][2]], two of the containing cells have gas, so in the next state of the grid, c[0][1] will NOT have gas:
O. -> .
.O

Following this pattern to its conclusion, from the previous state p, the current state of the grid c will be:
O.O
.O.
O.O

Note that the resulting output will have 1 fewer row and column, since the bottom and rightmost cells do not have a cell below and to the right of them, respectively.

Write a function solution(g) where g is an array of array of bools saying whether there is gas in each cell (the current scan of the nebula), and return an int with the number of possible previous states that could have resulted in that grid after 1 time step.  For instance, if the function were given the current state c above, it would deduce that the possible previous states were p (given above) as well as its horizontal and vertical reflections, and would return 4. The width of the grid will be between 3 and 50 inclusive, and the height of the grid will be between 3 and 9 inclusive.  The answer will always be less than one billion (10^9).
